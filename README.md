# C library for Epitech students

This is a set of useful C functions for Epitech projects.</br></br>
Includes:
- part of Epitech's Libmy functions
- a replica of Printf
- some utils
- csfml helpers

some functions can be banned for some projects (like time, rand, csfml helpers...), remember to delete them if not allowed in your project.
